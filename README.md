# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-PySpark
Semester project for Data Mining (DSML course) 

The dataset of this project was taken from the following repository:
https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md

The queries were answered using PySpark's RDD API. Additional python libraries like matplotlib and gmaps were used. Below we show the heatmap of some chosen countries (the intensity represents the mean number of coronavirus cases during the project's time window). For some reason it wouldn't show up after closing the notebook and reopening it.
